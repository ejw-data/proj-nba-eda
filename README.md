Definitions:  

**Hard cap**: A team salary figure (set at the apron) that, once triggered, cannot be crossed for any reason. A hard cap can be triggered in one of three ways:  
*  A team uses the non-taxpayer mid-level exception.  
*  A team uses the bi-annual exception.  
*  A team acquires a player through a sign-and-trade.
